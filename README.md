# Fuel-Delivery-Website
The Project is a Fuel Delivery website from which you can buy fuel online and refuel your vehicle at your desired location. It is a web application that overcomes the issue reason if vehicle stops due to lack of fuel, it will be very hard for the owner to push the vehicle to the nearest petrol pump. In some cases, people go to new location and sometimes they wonâ€™t be having any idea of the gas stations to refuel their vehicles. Sometimes it becomes complicated if we are not using any software to compare different properties and land.
 
The proposed system to develop website to deliver the fuel to those who need to refuel vehicles at any location and time. In this website two modules using user, fuel station as admin. Admin can verify Fuel details, then it will see user modules. Admin can add their branch information like address and google map geo location and kind of fuel provide. User can search by locality or station name and book the fuel on online website.
