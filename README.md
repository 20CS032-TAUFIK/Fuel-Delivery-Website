# Fuel-Delivery-Website
## Description

-  The Project is a Fuel Delivery website from which you can buy fuel online and refuel your vehicle at your desired location. It is a web application that overcomes the issue reason if vehicle stops due to lack of fuel, it will be very hard for the owner to push the vehicle to the nearest petrol pump. In some cases, people go to new location and sometimes they won’t be having any idea of the gas stations to refuel their vehicles. Sometimes it becomes complicated if we are not using any software to compare different properties and land.
- The proposed system to develop website to deliver the fuel to those who need to refuel vehicles at any location and time. In this website two modules using user, fuel station as admin. Admin can verify Fuel details, then it will see user modules. Admin can add their branch information like address and google map geo location and kind of fuel provide. User can search by locality or station name and book the fuel on online website.

## Limitation

- **Inaccurate Data:** It is seen that sometimes customer try to put inappropriate data on the site which miss leads customers.

- **Server Down: **The android mobile user will not be able to insert or view details if the server goes down. Thus, there is disadvantage of single point failure.

- **Fuel: **Fuel Cannot be tracked or cannot return. Fuel Cannot be verified for Purity.

## Future Enhancements

I am yet on the initial stage of this development project and hence i will be facing much more enhancement on this system. These are some of the upgrades that i thought on this Project.


- **Set vehicle location: **Owners and their cars are often in different locations, so people will surely appreciate it if they can just pin the location where their car is parked on the map and have car fuel brought there.

- **Share location details: **A feature that will enable customers to automatically share their location data with drivers without talking to them.

- **Payment system integrations: **Integrations with a number of different payment systems will enable buyers to send different payment types.

- ** Price comparison:** People should be able to consider different vendors and make informed decisions.

-  **Delivery Schedule: **Enabling clients to conveniently schedule fuel delivery will surely account for a better user experience.

This Web Application Is Having Very Simple UI To Use And It Provides One Type Of Satisfaction To The User. Bycreating This Website, I Get To Know Some Very Required Information About Developing A Project That Can Really Help To Solve Real Time Problems. We Get To Know The Whole Process That How The Companies Work To Develop Their Projects. During The Internship We Developed Some Skills And Get To Know That How To Use Thatefficiently To Fulfill The Client’S Requirement.
